        The Spectator was a periodical published daily by Joseph Addison and Sir Richard Steele, both politicians, which was one of the bestsellers of the 18th century. Its 500 issues sold up to 4000 copies a day, and carried news and comment, but especially comments on manners, morals and literature. The publication pretended to be the reports by a Mr Spectator on the conversations of a club comprising representatives of the country squirearchy, the town, commerce and the army. Its essays, as seen in this example, show that urban life in the 18th century was not so far different from today, with observations on begging and binge-drinking. ‘Mr Spectator’ particularly comments on debt – ‘[I am] extremely astonished that Men can be so insensible of the Danger of running into Debt’. The magazine of essays was a popular model for expressing various views on society in the 18th century. Though often short-lived, they sold well and were read by thousands. The Gentleman’s Magazine, Steele’s The Tatler, Samuel Johnson’s The Rambler and The Idler and others created an enthusiasm for discussing ideas and literature that were at the heart of literate thinking in 18th century England

        WASHINGTON — After four years of free Republican rein, President George W. Bush’s administration came up with what it thought was a sure way to counter the emboldened new Democratic majority on Capitol Hill when it came to the Iraq war in 2007: divide and conquer.
        <br>It failed. Democrats, who had just won the House and Senate by running against the war, were not about to suddenly change course. They remained united against the White House, spurring a furious funding fight. The events made it clear that the era of unfettered Republican control of Washington was over and that the two sides needed to come to an accommodation.
        <br>The parallels to today are obvious. Democrats believe that they won the House last year partly because of President Trump’s stridency on immigration and aren’t about to accede to his wall demands. The White House and congressional Republicans are finding that Democrats won’t be easily divided. And the two sides are going to need to come to an accommodation through the negotiations that begin on Wednesday or face another conflagration. The government shutdown was a test of wills; the border funding talks are a test of governance.
        <br>Negotiations over border funding, which will have only a couple of weeks to bear fruit before another potential shutdown looms, are the first real experiment in how divided government will or won’t work for the next two years. They could chart a course for future conflicts between Democrats, newly empowered in the House, and Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans, who face a difficult electoral landscape and a need to maintain their base of support.

        <br>“Everyone, everyone has skin in the game,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.
        <br>It was Mr. Schumer who suggested to his Republican counterpart, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, that the funding feud should be settled by a traditional joint committee of House and Senate appropriators. There were good reasons for that from Mr. Schumer’s perspective. For starters, it kept House Democrats and their majority leverage as a central element of the negotiations, a priority for Mr. Schumer, who has sought to fend off all attempts by Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell to break him away from Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
        <br>Perhaps more important, the appropriations process has been one of the few areas where Republicans and Democrats have managed to get along pretty well during the Trump administration. They have struck a series of bipartisan compromises that accomplished what the lawmakers wanted even if the White House was not always pleased with the results. It was the willingness of the appropriators to draft consensus spending bills that did not explicitly include wall money that finally caused Mr. Trump to balk, leading to the shutdown.
